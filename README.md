### Description
A fun API that shows users, their thoughts, and reactions to thoughts though an API. I used MongoDB as the database and Mongoose as the Object Data Modeling library.

### Installation
Make sure you have all the dependencies, plus MongoDB installed on your machine.

### Usage
Run the seeds with "npm run seed", run the application with "node server.js", and open up Postman (or insomnia) and run the routes!
